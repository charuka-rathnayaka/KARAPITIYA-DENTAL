Root canal treatment (also called endodontics) tackles infection at the centre of a tooth (the root canal system).When the blood or nerve supply of the tooth has become infected, the infection will spread and the tooth may need to be taken out if root canal treatment isn't carried out. During treatment, all the infection is removed from inside the root canal system. The root canal is filled and the tooth is sealed with a filling or crown to stop it becoming infected again. Root canal treatment usually requires 2 or 3 visits to your dentist.
