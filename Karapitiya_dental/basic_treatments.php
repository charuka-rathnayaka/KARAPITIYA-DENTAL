                    <p>Root canal treatment (also called endodontics) tackles infection at the centre of a tooth (the root canal system). 
                        When the blood or nerve supply of the tooth has become infected, the infection will spread and the tooth may need 
                        to be taken out if root canal treatment isn't carried out. During treatment, all the infection is removed from 
                        inside the root canal system. The root canal is filled and the tooth is sealed with a filling or crown to stop 
                        it becoming infected again. Root canal treatment usually requires 2 or 3 visits to your dentist.</p>

                    <p>A scale and polish is a quick cleaning of the teeth carried out by a dentist.  Usually using something called an 
                        Ultrasonic, the dentist will clean around the gum line on the back and front of your teeth to remove any plaque and tartar.
                          This treatment usually lasts a few minutes.  The treatment is finished by a quick polish of the teeth. </p>

                    <p>The wisdom teeth grow at the back of your gums and are the last teeth to come through, usually in your late teens or 
                        early twenties.Most people have 4 wisdom teeth, 1 in each corner. Wisdom teeth can sometimes emerge at an angle or
                         get stuck and only emerge partially. Wisdom teeth that grow through in this way are known as impacted. Impacted wisdom 
                         teeth can be removed on the NHS. Your dentist may perform the procedure, or may refer you to a dentist with a special 
                         interest or a hospital's oral and maxillofacial unit. You'll usually have to pay a charge for wisdom tooth removal. 
                         If you're referred to a hospital for NHS treatment, you won't have to pay a charge. Your dentist can also refer you for 
                         private wisdom teeth treatment if you wish.</p>

                    <p>Teeth whitening involves bleaching your teeth to make them a lighter colour.Teeth whitening can't make your 
                        teeth brilliant white, but it can lighten the existing colour by several shades. Standard teeth whitening 
                        involves several visits to the dentist, plus sessions at home wearing a mouthguard containing bleaching gel. 
                        The whole process takes a couple of months. A newer procedure called laser whitening or power whitening is 
                        done at the dentist's surgery and takes about an hour. Teeth whitening is cosmetic and therefore generally 
                        only available privately. It's occasionally available on the NHS if you have a clinical need â€“ for example, 
                        to whiten a tooth that's gone black because the nerve has died.</p>
